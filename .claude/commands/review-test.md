Review test files in this repository for compliance with ARO-CAPZ test suite patterns and guidelines.

## What to Review

Ask me which test file(s) to review, or review all test files if I don't specify.

## Review Checklist

For each test file, check and report on:

### 1. Configuration Management
- Uses `config := NewTestConfig()` instead of direct env var access
- No hardcoded values (cluster names, regions, paths, etc.)
- New config needs use `GetEnvOrDefault()` pattern
- Report any hardcoded values with file:line reference

### 2. Helper Function Usage
- Uses `CommandExists()` to check for required tools
- Uses `RunCommand()` for shell command execution
- Uses `FileExists()` / `DirExists()` for path validation
- Uses `SetEnvVar()` for temporary environment changes
- Report any direct `os.Stat()`, `exec.Command()`, or `os.Setenv()` calls

### 3. Test Structure
- Function names follow `Test<Phase>_<Functionality>` pattern
- Has prerequisite validation with `t.Skipf()`
- Uses `t.Run()` for subtests when appropriate
- Report any missing prerequisite validations

### 4. Error Handling
- Uses `t.Errorf()` for non-fatal errors (can continue)
- Uses `t.Fatalf()` for fatal errors (cannot continue)
- Uses `t.Logf()` for progress/informational messages
- Report improper error handling (e.g., using Fatal when Error would suffice)

### 5. Sequential Dependencies
- Tests check if previous phases completed
- Tests are idempotent (safe to re-run)
- Tests skip gracefully if prerequisites not met
- Report any tests that would break when re-run

### 6. Security Issues
- Check for command injection vulnerabilities
- Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Check for unsafe file operations
- Flag the known issue in `06_verification_test.go:68` (base64 decode vulnerability)

### 7. CLAUDE.md Compliance
- Follows patterns documented in CLAUDE.md
- Aligns with test architecture (sequential, idempotent)
- Uses proper logging and error handling
- Report any deviations from documented patterns

## Output Format

Provide feedback as:

**File: `test/filename_test.go`**

**Strengths:**
- Lists what's done correctly

**Issues Found:**
- Issue description with `test/filename_test.go:123` reference
- Suggested fix aligned with CLAUDE.md guidelines

**Recommendations:**
- Specific improvements or refactorings

## Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Security issues, breaking patterns, will cause failures
- **Important**: Deviates from patterns, not following best practices
- **Minor**: Style improvements, consistency tweaks
